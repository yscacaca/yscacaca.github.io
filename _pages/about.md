Shuochao Yao is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at George Mason University. His research centers on building physically aware, resource-efficient, reliable, and predictable artificial intelligence systems to enable the next generation of Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). His work bridges theory and practice, with an emphasis on system-level design that addresses the constraints of embedded and mobile platforms. More broadly, he is interested in developing sensing and machine learning systems that are easy to deploy and capable of operating robustly in real-world environments, combining advances in embedded AI, mobile computing, and system optimization to deliver practical, intelligent applications.

I am looking for well-motivated students interested in bridging deep learning techniques to IoT/CPS. If you are interested in my research, please drop me an email.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
